How to be a Content Creator

<h3>
<p>Learn how you can turn content creation from a hobby into a prospective income!</p></h3>


    <p>The main purpose of this website is to explain the pros and cons of content creation and to give the reader different examples of types of content they could potentially create. After the COVID outbreak, the use of social media and consumption of content increased significantly. </p>
    <p>Once the reader has browsed through the website, I hope for them to be more informed and open to the idea of creating content on different platforms. The main goal I would set for this website is to teach someone how they might get started on their own journey into content creation. </p>
    <p>Since most creators have a plan when they begin making content for different platforms, I also want to share with the reader how someone might have different motivations for creating content and trying to pursue content creation as a career. </p>
