<p>I am a senior here at Mizzou</p></h3>

<body>
  <p>  I still have a year or two before I can graduate. I am majoring in Digital Storytelling with a minor in Business. I have a husband and beautiful 8-year-old boy, along with two dogs and a cat; so, we have a <strong>full house!</strong> </p>
  Going to school along with a full-time job here at the University keeps me busy. <blockquote>I do currently maintain the Cashiers website for the University, so I have a small amount of experience with HTML and CSS.</blockquote>In my free time, I also compete on <em>two Rainbow Six Siege teams</em>; one for the Mizzou Club Team and another is an all-female team. <br>I am hopeful after the completion of my degree that I will be able to get a job in esports. Esports has grown to become a passion of mine that I want to share with others.
