            <p>I am a senior here at Mizzou and I'm majoring in Digital Storytelling with a minor in Business. I have a husband and beautiful 8-year-old boy, along with two dogs and a cat; so we have a <strong>full house! </strong></p>
            <p>Going to school along with a full-time job keeps me pretty busy.My work here at the University has allowed me to gain some experience in HTML and CSS by maintaining the Cashiers website. </p>
            <p>With any free time I have left, I also compete on <em>two Rainbow Six Siege teams</em>; one is a school affiliated team and another is an all-female team. Outside of those, I additionally try to stream on Twitch as content creation is another hobby I enjoy.</p>
                <br> I am hopeful after the completion of my degree that I will be able to get a job in esports. Esports and content creation has grown to become a passion of mine that I want to share with others.
