            <p>Twitch, next to YouTube, is one of the most widely known streaming services available at this time. It is a free platform that allows a user to create an account and watch people play games. If you’ve ever wanted to try a game before you buy it, now you can, sort of… Twitch has many different types of games, genres, and categories that you can choose from. </p>
            <p>They range from “Just Chatting” which is solely the creator talking to their chat; all the way to the latest “Call of Duty” where you can watch someone play the campaign or just public matches. Once you create your Twitch account, you can also set it up to stream your own “Just Chatting” or specific game. Now, you can learn how to do both!</p>
