     My name is April, and I am a senior here at Mizzou. Due to my schedule, I still have a year or two before I can graduate. I am majoring in Digital Storytelling with a minor in Business. I have a husband and beautiful 8-year-old boy, along with two dogs and a cat; so, we have a full house! Going to school along with a full-time job here at the University keeps me busy. I do currently maintain the Cashiers website for the University, so I have a small amount of experience with HTML and CSS. In my free time, I also compete on two Rainbow Six Siege teams; one for the Mizzou Club Team and another is an all-female team. I am hopeful after the completion of my degree that I will be able to get a job in esports. Esports has grown to become a passion of mine that I want to share with others.
