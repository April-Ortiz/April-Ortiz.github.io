            <strong>Creating a social media account on Twitter to tie all your content together. </strong>
            
            <p> As a content creator, the first thing you will want to do will be to establish who you want to be. Do you want to live behind a persona like Dr. Disrespect? Do you want to be yourself and have your identity well known by people? Once you establish that, you can create an online name which will carry over to each platform you have, not just Twitch or YouTube. </p>
            <p>Having the same name on each account will make you more discoverable to new viewers which will allow you to grow exponentially. Once you begin to grow an audience, they will start to recommend your content to other people which is how you begin to grow as a content creator.  </p>
        <br>
            <strong>Creating a Twitch Page to stream your favorite games.</strong>
            <p>Twitch, next to YouTube, is one of the most widely known streaming services available at this time. It is a free platform that allows a user to create an account and watch people play games. If you’ve ever wanted to try a game before you buy it, now you can, sort of… Twitch has many different types of games, genres, and categories that you can choose from. </p>
            <p>They range from “Just Chatting” which is solely the creator talking to their chat; all the way to the latest “Call of Duty” where you can watch someone play the campaign or just public matches. Once you create your Twitch account, you can also set it up to stream your own “Just Chatting” or specific game. Now, you can learn how to do both! </p>
        <br>
            <strong>How to upload a video to YouTube.</strong>
            <p>YouTube is a great source of information for people to who want to learn how to create different home projects or maybe learn a new skill. You can also upload your own content for other people to consume as well! </p>
            <p>Are you a graphic designer and want to showcase your latest work? Do you have an Etsy shop and want to teach people how to make similar products? YouTube can be an endless space of knowledge if you know what to search for. All you need to do is create and account and your off to the races! Next, you need to figure out what content you want to share with the world. </p>
